# cs50web-project4-network

This project aims to create a social network application, inspired by Twitter. Users will be able to make posts, go to an "all posts" page, display profile pages, follow other users, experience pagination, edit posts, and "like/unlike" posts.

This application runs on the Django web framework, and as such makes extensive use of Python. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also used.
